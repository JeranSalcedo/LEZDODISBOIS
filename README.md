# UDP Multiplayer Card Game

A real-time multiplayer card game developed in Java using UDP sockets and Swing.

The application implements a client-server architecture where players connect to a central game server, exchange cards in real time, and compete to complete a four-of-a-kind hand before other players react.

Originally developed as a team project for CMSC 137 (Data Communications and Networking) at the University of the Philippines Los Baños.

## Game Layout and Protocol

### I. Basic Game Layout

1. Server will create a game instance that will require n players (min. 3 players, max 13)

2. Once the number of players matches the game quota, the game will start

3. Server will generate n sets of 4 cards, each set containing the same value, but with different suits (ex. 3 of Clubs, 3 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, and 3 of Diamond)

4. Once the server generates all the cards needed, the server will shuffle the cards and distribute them evenly to the clients

5. Once the clients have received their cards, the server will send a signal that indicates that each client must choose a card to pass to the next player

6. A 3-second timer will start, and each client must choose a card to pass during the time limit. If the client fails to choose a card within 3 seconds, the first card in their hand will be chosen as the default card to pass

7. Once the timer is up, the chosen cards will be sent to the server for redistribution. The redistribution process works by giving the card of a client to the one next to the client in a clockwise motion

8. Once the clients see their new set of cards, process 6-7 will repeat until one or more client/s has/have 4 equal cards. Those clients will receive a notification that they should quickly press “Enter”

9. Once a client presses “Enter”, the server will broadcast to the rest of the clients that they should press “Enter” quickly

10. The server will send a list of clients, ranked by who pressed “Enter” quicker

### III. Wireframe
#### Sample of Login UI (Optional)<br />
+When the code is executed, a GUI will pop-up, asking for the user's Name, Sever ID, and Port<br />
+After filling up needed information, the UI will change into the game area<br />

## Designations
  
#### Signals: <br />
  +SC = Send Cards <br />
  +TM = Timer <br />
  
Player ID: 01,02,03,.....,12,13 <br />

#### Cards: <br />
  +Suites: C (Clubs), S (Spades), H (Hearts), D (Diamond) <br />
  +Values: A (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T (Ten), J (Jack), Q (Queen), K (King) <br />
  +Sample Card Code: AC (Ace of Clubs) <br />

#### Code Pattern: <br />
##### Sample code: SC04KCAC3C2S <br />
+SC - Server Sends Cards <br />
+04 - Player ID <br />
+KCAC3C2S - Cards <br />
